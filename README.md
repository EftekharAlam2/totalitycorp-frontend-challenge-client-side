## [E-Commerce Website (Click)](https://totalitycorp-frontend.web.app/)

Homepage:
The main page of the website features a cool section showcasing our products. You can sort these products based on their categories, maximum prices, and ratings. This helps you quickly find what you're looking for.

Cart Details:
Now, here's a neat feature: if you log in using your email, anything you add to your shopping cart will be saved in a special place called "My Cart." But if you're not logged in, you won't be able to add items to your cart. Oh, and if you use GitHub to log in, keep in mind that it doesn't provide an email, so this feature might not work for you.

"My Cart" Page:
On the "My Cart" page, you'll see all the items you've added. You can easily change the quantities, add more, or remove items. When you're ready to make a purchase, just hit the checkout button, and you're good to go.
